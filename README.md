## My Process üõ†Ô∏è

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling. Some key learnings include:

- Creating a responsive card layout
- Implementing hover effects
- Using Flexbox for alignment

Here's a code snippet I'm particularly proud of:

```css
.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.card-image:hover .overlay {
  opacity: 1;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

This CSS creates a smooth hover effect for the NFT image.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving my CSS animations
- Exploring more advanced responsive design techniques
- Incorporating accessibility features

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An excellent resource for HTML and CSS references.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Great for understanding Flexbox and other CSS concepts.
